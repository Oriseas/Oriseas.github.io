    <div class = "bioP">

  <p2 class = "bioT">Born in Indonesia, went to high school in Qatar, and now currently studying in University of Washington - Bothell with the aim of obtaining a Bachelor of Science
    in Computer Science and Software Engineering. During my time studying the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering for over 4 years, I have grown a passion
    for the technicalities in the software industry, such as programming and structuring softwares. Recently, I have also grown a passion for the functionalities in software industry,
    specifically as a QA Analyst, after an internship experience with Accenture on a Data Migration Project.
  </p2>

    <p3 class = "bioT">As an academic, I have opened up myself to many experiences, such as participating in international competitions, being the co-creator and vice president of a local Red Cross Club, and
    the aforementioned internship experience. With these experiences, I managed to enforce my soft skills in leadership, negotiation, public speaking, and communication while expanding my
    technical skill set of approaching and visualizing big data.
  </p3>

     <p4 class = "bioT">Currently I have a year left before I obtain my degree. Yet, I have yet to find a field or topic of work that would immerse me as much equally as I would be
       when crafting music and videos during my leisure. Thus, although my academic goal is to get a degree, my personal goal is to find opportunities in which I can experience
       the different aspects of the industry.

    </div>
      <p4 class = "recentD"> The project assigned is based on financial services, specifically on the topic of data migration. Although the focus of the project
        is finance, I was assigned in the technological department. My daily work consists of visualizing data obtained from Jira, which is then used for
        daily reports. The daily reports is used to track the progress and movement of defects during testing and incidients during post-production.
        Due to the difficulty of the project, I was often needed to fulfill a night shift, in which my activities include logging incidents/defects into Jira and
        coordinating with clients to ensure progress upon resolving them. Due to the project being under resourced during testing, I was also assigned the responsibility
        to manage the progress and activities of testers on some days. Although the task and responsiblity can feel overwhelming at times (along with much late night work).
        I felt I was taught many lessons from this single experience. The important one being is to love what you do. Although it might seem generic, I have seen through
        first-hand experience how much effort individuals can exert on a job they enjoy.

        <p4 id = "rCrossD"> <br>Created a club with a colleague based on the intention of
        creating fund raising awareness events for Shoreline Community College. During
      my time as a Vice President, I've coordinated a large carnival event on campus to fundraise
      for Seattle's Children Hospital. The event proved to be a success after reaching $200. Other
      events, in which I coordinated include weekly clothing drives and a marathon to raise general health awareness.
      Other than fulfilling my leadership role, I also managed and designed all public relations material, allowing me to become well
    acquinted with photoshop and strategies in managing social media platforms. </p4>

        <p3 id = "subtitle2">November 2017</p3>
        <p4 id = "rCrossD2"> <br> Joined as a delegate of Sweden with the intention of practicing
        negotiation, diplimacy, networking, and leadership skills. Although the event is quite unrelated
        to my field of work, I believed the skills I gained would improve my soft skills while also raising
        my own awareness on current and future topics in politics. Simply put, I had nothing to lose by joining this
        event and much more to gain. So, I told myself, "why not?".  Assigned in the General Assembly
        Committee, discussions are based on the politics of "Uses of Outer Space" and "Durable Peace
        and Sustainable Development in Africa".</p4>

        <p4 id = "rCrossD2"> <br> Joined as a contestant in a team of three, the event is an international tournament with three
        rounds which can be identified as local, international, and champions. Fortunately, my first time participating included all three
        rounds, which takes place in Doha, Malaysia, and Yale University respectively. All three rounds required me to compete by debating,
        persuasive writing, and knowledge testing based on various subjects. Taking this during highschool really shaped on the activities I would
        eventually take further down my academic journey as I learned the joy of taking opportunities as they appear.
